  The ::before pseudo-element seems intended to be a small dot following the cursor.
  It uses CSS variables --x and --y which are set by the JavaScript.
  The original transform had `var(-0.5rem)` and `var(50%)`.
  If it's meant to follow the mouse, it should use `var(--x)` and `var(--y)`.
  However, to keep it exactly as provided by the user, I will use the original transform values.
  Its background is #160000, which is very dark and may not be visible on a dark theme.
